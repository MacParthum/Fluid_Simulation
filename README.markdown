# Fluid Simulation

A Pen created by Jeff Thomas on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/aecend/pen/WbONyK](https://codepen.io/aecend/pen/WbONyK).

I thought this fluid simulator was amazing and the script.js page has tons of comments by the creator.  I wanted to play around with it an make my own version of it. My intention is to make this cool toy take up the majority of a standard monitor :)  On lines 78-79 of the script.js you can change the canvas width and height. You can change the color on line 398 of the script.js.  The way it is set up and commented it's a great way to learn for a begginer.
